Project Overview

Welcome to the Macaron Cafe Conveyor Belt Order System! In this project, we aim to create a codebase for a conveyor belt system that stops at a specific table to facilitate order fullfillment. The system is designed to streamline the process of delivering orders to customers in a timely and efficient manner.
