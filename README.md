3D Printed Conveyor Belt with Raspberru Pi Control

Project Overview

Welcome to the Macaron Cafe Conveyor Belt Order System! In this project, we aim to create a codebase for a conveyor belt system that stops at a specific table to facilitate order fullfillment using a 3D printer to print our conveyor belt and a Raspberry Pi to control the conveyor belt. The system is designed to streamline the process of delivering orders to customers in a timely and efficient manner.

Features

Conveyor Belt Operation: The 3D printed conveyor belt simulates the movement of a real conveyor, allowing for the smooth transportation of delicious macarons!

Order Assignment: The system assigns unique identifiers to each order, facilitating organized order management.

Raspberry Pi Control: The Raspberry Pi acts as the central control unit, managing the conveyor belt's movement and stopping at specific intervals.

"Table Stops": The conveyor belt halts at a designated table, providing a convenient and efficent means for customers to pick up their orders. 

How It Works

1. Customer places order, each order being assigned to a unique identifier
2. Customer proceeds to the designated table as indicated on their receipt.
3. Employees or bakers place the customer's order on the conveyor belt.
4. The employee presses a button corresponding to the customer's assigned table, e.g., "Table 6", initiating the delivery process.
5. The Raspberry Pi, serving as the control unit, initiates the conveyor belt's movement.
6. When the conveyor belt reaches a table where an order is destined, it stops for a set period to allow for order pickup.
7. Customer picks up orders during the stoppage period.
8. The system updates the order status reflect successful delivery.
