Macaron Cafe Conveyor Belt

Project Overview

Welcome to the Macaron Cafe Conveyor Belt Order System! In this project, we aim to create a codebase for a conveyor belt system that stops at a specific table to facilitate order fullfillment. The system is designed to streamline the process of delivering orders to customers in a timely and efficient manner.

Features

Conveyor Belt Operation: Simulates the movement of a conveyor belt. Order Assignment: Assigns orders to specific tables. Table Stops: Ensures that the conveyor belt stops at the designated table for order pickup.

How It Works

1. Customer places order, each order being assigned to a unique identifier
2. Customer proceeds to the designated table as indicated on their receipt.
3. Employees or bakers place the customer's order on the conveyor belt.
4. The employee presses a button corresponding to tthe customer's assigned table, e.g., "Table 6", initiating the delivery process.
5. When the conveyor belt reaches a table where an order is destined, it stops for a set period to allow for order pickup.
6. Customer pick up orders during the stoppage period.
7. The system updates the order status reflect successful delivery.
